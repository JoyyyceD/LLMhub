# Open vs Private Boundaries

## Open (public)

- Methodology workflow
- Input/output contracts
- Skill trigger patterns
- Example payloads and responses

## Private (not public)

- Proprietary weight tuning parameters
- Provider routing business rules
- Internal benchmark datasets and feedback logs
- Commercial pricing and customer-specific policies

## Rule

Public artifacts must be enough to explain "how decisions are made" but not enough to reproduce private operational advantage.
