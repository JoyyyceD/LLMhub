It is built for agents that operate across entire workflows rather than single prompts, making it especially effective for large codebases, complex refactors, and multi-step debugging that unfolds over time. The model shows deeper contextual understanding, stronger problem decomposition, and greater reliability on hard engineering tasks than prior generations.

Beyond coding, Opus 4.6 excels at sustained knowledge work. It produces near-production-ready documents, plans, and analyses in a single pass, and maintains coherence across very long outputs and extended sessions. This makes it a strong default for tasks that require persistence, judgment, and follow-through, such as technical design, migration planning, and end-to-end project execution.

Compared to GPT-5, Codex is more steerable, adheres closely to developer instructions, and produces cleaner, higher-quality code outputs. Reasoning effort can be adjusted with the `reasoning.effort` parameter. Read the [docs here](https://openrouter.ai/docs/use-cases/reasoning-tokens#reasoning-effort-level)

Codex integrates into developer environments including the CLI, IDE extensions, GitHub, and cloud tasks. It adapts reasoning effort dynamically—providing fast responses for small tasks while sustaining extended multi-hour runs for large projects. The model is trained to perform structured code reviews, catching critical flaws by reasoning over dependencies and validating behavior against tests. It also supports multimodal inputs such as images or screenshots for UI development and integrates tool use for search, dependency installation, and environment setup.

With 10 billion activated parameters (230 billion total), it delivers near-frontier intelligence across general reasoning, tool use, and multi-step task execution while maintaining low latency and deployment efficiency.

The model excels in code generation, multi-file editing, compile-run-fix loops, and test-validated repair, showing strong results on SWE-Bench Verified, Multi-SWE-Bench, and Terminal-Bench. It also performs competitively in agentic evaluations such as BrowseComp and GAIA, effectively handling long-horizon planning, retrieval, and recovery from execution errors.

Benchmarked by [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/minimax-m2), MiniMax-M2 ranks among the top open-source models for composite intelligence, spanning mathematics, science, and instruction-following. Its small activation footprint enables fast inference, high concurrency, and improved unit economics, making it well-suited for large-scale agents, developer assistants, and reasoning-driven applications that require responsiveness and cost efficiency.

The model includes a fully automated synthetic data pipeline for scalable pre-training, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. It uses large-scale continual pre-training on diverse agentic data to boost reasoning and stay fresh. It also features end-to-end on-policy RL with a customized Group Relative Policy Optimization, including token-level gradients and negative sample filtering for stable training.

- Input tokens comprise of Prompt tokens (user prompt) + Citation tokens (these are processed tokens from running searches)
- Deep Research runs multiple searches to conduct exhaustive research. Searches are priced at $5/1000 searches. A request that does 30 searches will cost $0.15 in this step.
- Reasoning is a distinct step in Deep Research since it does extensive automated reasoning through all the material it gathers during its research phase.
